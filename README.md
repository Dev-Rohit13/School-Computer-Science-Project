# School-Computer-Science-Project
Rohit and Romeo's Computer Science Project



This is the GitHub repo for our project, the files Heat Map A and Heat Map B are the output of the entire program.



Heat Map A and Heat Map B are generated as a result of running the code for it. (the python files titled the same names)



Test 3.py and Test 4.py are test files used for testing the code in the Heat Map files. Test 3.py holds significance as it defines a significant function used in the project. Test 4.py was the testing for Test 3.py



Map.html can be disregarded, was a test html file output (As all of the html files are generated from the python) and this is not a neccessary file.



To dowload the maps, click into one of them, right click on raw, and clickl save as. Then open the html file and it will show you the heat map.
